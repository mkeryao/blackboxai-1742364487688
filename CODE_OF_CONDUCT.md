comments, commits, code, wiki editsThe project setup is now complete with all necessary files and configurations. Hereâ€™s a summary of what has been created:

1. **Java Source Code**: All controllers, services, models, and configurations for the JobFlow application have been implemented.
2. **Database Initialization**: An SQL script to set up the database schema and initial data.
3. **Docker Configuration**: A Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml to containerize the application and its dependencies.
4. **Monitoring**: Prometheus configuration for monitoring the application.
5. **Documentation**: README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, and LICENSE files to guide users and contributors.
6. **Error Handling**: A global exception handler to manage errors consistently across the application.
7. **Security**: JWT authentication and role-based access control implemented.

You can now build and run the application using Docker. To do this, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will build the application and start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

If you need any further modifications or additional features, please let me know!
